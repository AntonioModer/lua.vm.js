The Lua VM, on the Web

Online demo: http://kripken.github.io/lua.vm.js/lua.vm.js.html


Status
======

This began as an experiment to see how fast the Lua VM can run on the web. That was successful (performance is quite good in both firefox and chrome). The project is now looking for someone to take it upon themselves that knows Lua and the Lua VM.

Building
========

To build, run `make emscripten` in the `lua` subdirectory
